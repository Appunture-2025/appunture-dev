taBLE Of COntEntS
Along with herbal medicine, acupuncture has been used for more than 2500 years as one
of the main pillars of traditional medicine in the Western Pacific Region. Accordingly,
the WHO Regional Committee for the Western Pacific adopted resolutions supporting the
proper use of acupuncture and herbal medicine in 1985 and 1987.
With the aim of standardization in the field of acupuncture, the WHO Regional Office for
the Western Pacific organized a Working Group for the Standardization of Acupuncture
nomenclature in 1981 and, after 10 years of effort, a consensus was reached on the
proposed standard international acupuncture nomenclature. In 1991, A Proposed Standard
International Acupuncture Nomenclature was published by WHO Headquarters and
a revised edition of Standard Acupuncture Nomenclature was published by the WHO
Regional Office for the Western Pacific.
It was reported, however, that there was controversy among Member States regarding
approximately one-fourth of regular acupuncture point locations, raising doubts and
uncertainty regarding the efficacy and safety of acupuncture treatment. It is not known
when this disparity in location of acupuncture points first arose but, in recent decades,
there has been a growing international demand for standardization of acupuncture point
locations for education, research and clinical practice. However, since each Member State
has its own initiatives and traditions, international standardization of acupuncture point
locations has proved extremely difficult.
As an initial step in standardizing acupuncture point locations, the WHO Western Pacific
Regional Office convened the first Informal Consultation on the Development of WHO
Standard of acupuncture Point Locations in October 2003. Experts from China, Japan
and the republic of Korea attended that consultation, and 10 further serial meetings were
organized subsequently by the Regional Office. In the beginning, it appeared it would be
almost impossible to harmonize the activities of the various participants. However, with
the passing of time and the development of mutual understanding and trust, the experts
managed to reach a consensus on most of the controversial acupuncture point locations,
one by one. It took three years to achieve a set of internationally unified acupuncture point
locations, an effort that has provided a firm and solid basis in the field of acupuncture.

Recently, modern scientific apparatus, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging
(f-MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) has been utilized for acupuncture
research. However, that research has not focused on developing standard acupuncture point
locations. Therefore, the experts taking part in the consultations agreed on the development
of principles and methods by combining document analysis, experts’ clinical experiences
and factual measurements. Their efforts and the resulting outcomes will further enhance
scientific research on acupuncture point locations.
I would like to highlight that the experts involved in this project will be remembered, not
just for standardizing acupuncture point locations, but also for building team spirit among
international scholars in the field of traditional medicine.

PREFACE
Acupuncture has been practised for more than 2500 years in the Western Pacific Region
and has become a global therapeutic method in recent decades. However, it was reported
that acupuncturists differed by up to 25% in the acupuncture points they used, raising
doubts and uncertainty regarding the efficacy and safety of acupuncture treatment, as well
as causing difficulties in the fields of acupuncture research and education. Member States
therefore increasely began to demand standardization in acupuncture point locations.
Responding to this request, the WHO Western Pacific Regional Office initiated a project
to reach consensus on acupuncture point locations and thus convened 11 serial meetings,
resulting in these guidelines.
The standard for acupuncture point names used in the guidelines is based on WHO 90/8579-
atar-8000, A Proposed Standard for International Acupuncture Nomenclature. However,
while standardized measurement systems for length and width generally require adoption
of an international unit system, it is impossible to use any absolute standard value to
determine the location of acupuncture points on the human body due to the vast differences
in peoples’ sizes and heights. Only by using the Equal Proportional Measurement method,
also known as the Proportional Bone (Skeletal) Measurement method, can the proper
location of acupuncture points be established for all population groups and individuals.
this method was adopted by WHO as the standard measuring unit for acupuncture points
at an international conference held in Seoul, republic of Korea, in 1987. this measuring
unit has therefore been adopted in these guidelines for location of acupuncture points.

2 General Guidelines for Acupuncture Point Locations
I. Scope
This Standard stipulates the methodology for locating acupuncture points on the surface
of the human body, as well as the locations of 361 acupuncture points. The Standard is
applicable for teaching, research, clinical service, publication and academic exchanges
involving acupuncture.
II. Terms and definitions
The following terms and definitions are used in this Standard.
1. Standard measuring units:
Proportional bone (skeletal) cun (B-cun)
This method divides the height of the human body into 75 equal units. Using joints
on the surface of the body as the primary landmarks, the length and width of every
body part is measured by such proportions. The specific method is: divide the height
of the human body into 75 equal units, then estimate the length and width of a certain
part of the body according to such units. One unit is equal to one cun. For further
information on the commonly used proportional bone (skeletal) cun of a whole body,
refer to the related section on page 11.
Finger cun (F-cun)
This method is based on the finger cun of the person to be measured for acupuncture
point locations. For information on the commonly used method of measurement, refer
to the section on Locating Method by “finger-cun measurement” on page 13.
Fingerbreadth (F-breadth)
This method utilizes the width of the distal phalanx of the middle finger. This should
be distinguished from the middle finger cun. This method is rarely used e.g. for
locating ST6 and ST40.
2. Standard position and terms of direction:
The standard position and the terms for the orientation of the human body used in
traditional acupuncture point location are not the same as those used in modern
anatomy. For example, according to the traditional method, the palmar side of the
upper limbs, or the flexional side, is called the medial aspect. This medial aspect is
the distribution area of the acupuncture points of the three Yin hand meridians. The
dorsal side of the upper limbs, or the extensional side, is called the lateral aspect.
This lateral aspect is the distribution area of the acupuncture points of the three Yang
hand meridians. The side of the lower limbs closer to the midline is called the medial
aspect, which is the distribution area of the acupuncture points of the three Yin foot
meridians. The side of the lower limbs away from the midline is called the lateral
WHO Standard aCUPUnCtUrE POInt LOCatIOnS 3
aspect. the posterior portion of the lower limbs is called the posterior aspect, and this
apsect, along with the lateral aspect, is the distribution area of the acupuncture points
of the three Yang foot meridians. The anterior and posterior median lines of the head,
face and trunk are the respective distribution areas of the Conception Vessel and the
governor Vessel. these median lines are the baselines for locating acupuncture points
on either side of each pair of the two meridians.
the modern anatomical position is adopted by this Standard to describe acupuncture
point locations: the body stands upright, eyes look forward, feet together with toes
pointing forward and upper limbs hanging by the sides with palms facing forward.
For the location of certain specific points, other positions are recommended, such as
the knee-chest position (BL35), lying on the side with the thigh flexed (GB30), etc.
terms of direction (Figures 1 and 2)
the terms of direction follow standard anatomical terminology.
• Medial and lateral: closer to the median sagittal plane is medial; further away
from the median sagittal plane is lateral. On the forearm, the same concepts
are replaced with ulnar and radial, and on the legs, with tibial and fibular.
• Superior and inferior: closer to the upper (head) extremity of the body is
superior; closer to the lower (feet) extremity of the body is inferior. Superior
and inferior may also be used to relate the location of acupuncture points to
other points or anatomical landmarks. In this case they refer to directly above
or below on a straight line.
• Anterior and posterior: closer to the ventral surface of the human body is
anterior; closer to the dorsal surface is posterior.
• Proximal and distal: closer to the trunk is proximal; further away from the
trunk is distal.

4. regions of body
the regions of human body used in the description of acupuncture point locations are
based mainly on the latest version of International Anatomical Terminology, issued
by the Federative Committee on Anatomical Terminology (FCAT) in 1998. Some
regions in the International Anatomical Terminology are too difficult a fit for location
of acupuncture points. Here regions of the body are divided into the head, neck, back,
chest, abdomen, limbs and perineum. the smaller subdivisions of the body are as
follows:
Regions Borderline

III. Principles and methods for locating acupuncture points on the surface of the body
1. Principles for locating acupuncture points on the surface of the body:
To locate an acupuncture point, a combined approach using literature analysis,
clinical practice and actual and proportional measurement is used. In selecting
literature for analysis, special importance is attached to ancient and modern literature
about acupuncture point locations that has a ‘national standard’ nature, such as
Huangdi Mingtang Jing, Zhenjiu Jiayi Jing, Beiji Qianjin Fang and Tongren Shuxue
Zhenjiu Tujing. When descriptions of acupuncture point locations in ancient literature
are not clear, the following four principles are used to determine the proper location:
• Priority is given to the anatomical landmark method when it does not conform to
finger-cun measurement.
• Full consideration should be given to all relevant information in the original
literature about the acupuncture point and its location area, sequence and name.
• When determining the location of an acupuncture point, it is important to check
its location in relation to the location of other relevant points.
• Relevant acupuncture point charts or models in the original literature should be
referred to in order to better understand the location of the acupuncture point.
2. Methods for locating acupuncture points on the surface of the body:
Three methods are used for locating acupuncture points:
• The anatomical landmark method;
• The proportional bone (skeletal) measurement method; and
• The finger-cun measurement method
In practice, it is often neccessary to combine all three methods when locating an
acupuncture point. The methods primarily used are the anatomical landmark and
proportional bone (skeletal) measurement. The finger-cun measurement can be used
when it is difficult to locate the acupuncture point with the above two methods.
The anatomical landmark method:
This method utilizes anatomical landmarks on the surface of the body to locate
acupuncture points. Anatomical landmarks may be classified into two types: fixed
WHO STANDARD ACUPUNCTURE POINT LOCATIONS 11
landmarks and movable landmarks.
Fixed landmarks refer to protuberances or depressions formed by the joints and
muscles; contours of the eyes, ears, nose and mouth; fingernails and toenails; the
nipples; the navel and so on. For example, the location of GB34 is described as
“anterior and distal to the head of the fibula”.
Movable landmarks refer to the gaps, depressions, wrinkles and peaks which appear
along with the movement of joints, muscles, tendons and skin. For example, SI19
is located in the depression formed just anterior to the centre of the tragus when the
mouth is opened slightly.
Locations of commonly used anatomical landmarks on the surface of the body for
locating acupuncture points include:
a) The 2nd rib: the rib at the same level as the sternal angle; it can be palpated
inferior to the clavicle. (Fig 17)
b) The 4th intercostal space: at the same level as the nipples in males. (Fig 17)
c) The spinous process of the 7th cervical vertebra: the most prominent spinous
process on the posterior median line of the neck, which moves with the turning of
the head. (Fig 18)
d) The spinous process of the 3rd thoracic vertebra: the intersection of the posterior
median line and the line connecting the medial ends of the two spines of the
scapulae, when the subject stands upright with arms by the sides. (Fig 18)
e) The spinous process of the 7th thoracic vertebra: the intersection of the posterior
median line and the line connecting the two inferior angles of the scapulae when
the subject stands upright with arms by the sides. (Fig 18)
f) The spinous process of the 12th thoracic vertebra: on the posterior midline, at the
same level as the midpoint of the line connecting the inferior angle of the scapula
with the highest point of the iliac crest when the subject stand upright with arms
by the sides. (Fig 18)
g) The spinous process of the 4th lumbar vertebra: the intersection of the posterior
median line and the line connecting the highest points of the two iliac crests.
 (Fig 18)
h) The spinous process of the 2nd sacral vertebra: the intersection of the line
connecting the inferior borders of the two posterior superior iliac spines and the
posterior median line. (Fig 18)
i) The sacral hiatus: at the same level as the two sacral cornu superior to the coccyx,
on the posterior median line. (Fig 18)
The proportional bone (skeletal) measurement method:
The proportional bone (skeletal) measurement method is also used to locate
acupuncture points on the body. This method uses landmarks on the body surface,
12 general guidelines for acupuncture Point Locations
primarily joints, to measure the length and width of various parts of the body.
acupuncture point location is based on the measurements of various parts of the
body from the book Lingshu chapter on Gudu, combined with the proportional
measurements created by later scholars. (the method is to divide the length between
two points of particular joints into equal portions. Each portion is equivalent to
one cun, and ten portions equal one chi). The primary proportional bone (skeletal)
measurements of the whole body can be seen in the following table.

The finger-cun measurement method:
The finger-cun measurement method refers to the proportional measurement method
for locating acupuncture points based on the size of the fingers of the person to
be mearsured. this method is mainly used on the lower limbs. When locating
an acupuncture point, the practitioner, in addition to using the proportional bone
(skeletal) measurement method, may use the finger-cun measurement of the patient
being measured in order to verify the standard location of the acupuncture point.
Middle-finger cun: The distance between the ends of the two radial creases of the
interphalangeal joints of the middle finger is taken as 1 F-cun when the thumb and the
middle finger are flexed to form a circle. (Fig 22)
Thumb measurement: the width of the interphalangeal joint of the thumb is taken as 1
F-cun. (Fig 23)
Finger width measurement: when the index, middle, ring and little fingers of the
subject are extended and closed together, the width of the four fingers on the dorsal
14 General Guidelines for Acupuncture Point Locations
crease of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the middle finger is taken as 3 F-cun.
(Fig 24)
IV. Description of acupuncture point locations
In acupuncture point location, a vertical and horizontal coordinate method is adopted
as much as possible. Using two intersecting lines to make a crossing point, first, the
distance on the y-coordinate (Y axis) is determined to draw the horizontal line on the
body, then the distance on the x-coordinate (X axis) is determined to draw the vertical
line on the body. The latest edition of International Anatomical Terminology is
utilized to describe the relevant anatomical parts of acupuncture point locations.
The description for acupuncture point locations does not include methods for
locating the acupuncture points. Notes will be added, when required, to explain the
specific body postures that are required to locate certain acupuncture points, as well
as the techniques for locating body surface landmarks, proportional bone (skeletal)
measurements, and the relationship with adjacent acupuncture points.
The focus of explanations for location of acupuncture points is on general body
positions. Only those special body positions required for certain acupuncture points
have specific notes under relevant items to explain their locations.
Notes offer supplementary explanations on the following related key points for
location of acupuncture points.
• A special body position required for acupuncture point location.
• The proportional bone (skeletal) measurement.
• Explanations of the method of locating certain anatomical landmarks.
• The relationship with adjacent acupuncture points or landmark acupuncture points.
• Explanations of the differences in surface landmarks between different genders
and individuals.
V. Controversial acupuncture point locations
Through several meetings with Member States organized by the WHO Regional
Office for the Western Pacific to review the 92 controversial acupuncture point
locations, 86 were standardized. However, the experts could only make a tentative
decision on the six remaining points. It was agreed that further scientific research,
such as multi-centred clinical trials, should be conducted on the six remaining
controversial acupuncture point locations.
The six controversial acupuncture points are LI19, LI20, PC8, PC9, GB30 and GV26.
Their alternative acupuncture point locations are described under “Remarks” in this
document.
